1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
Answer: Two values of the Boolean data type and the way we write them is "True" & "False".

2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
Answer: The three basic Boolean operators are AND, OR and NOT.

3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean
values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
Answer:
a. In the AND Operator table, the outcome is True if all the value of dataset is True or else is give False as output.
b. In the OR Operator table, the outcome is FALSE if all the value of dataset is FALSE or else is give TRUE as output.
c. In the NOT Operator table, it give opposite output of the given input, i.e., for input TRUE, it gives FALSE and vice versa.

4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5) --> True AND False = False
not (5 > 4) --> not True = False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5) --> Ture or False = True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) --> not(True or False) --> not True = False
(True and True) and (True == False) --> True and False = False
(not False) or (not True) --> True or False = True

5. What are the six comparison operators?
Answer: The six comparison operators are =, >, <, !=, <= and >=.

6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a
condition and when you would use one.
Answer: Assignment operator is "=" while the equal to operator is "==".
We can use an assignment operator to assigna a value to the variable while the equal to operator can be used in loops while checking the conditions for true or false.

7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')

Answer:
First Block:
spam = 0

Second Block:
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')

Third Block:
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')

8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints
Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
Answer:
spam = 0
if spam == 1:
print("Hello")
if spam == 2:
print("Howdy")
else:
print("Greeting!")

9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?
Answer: Ctrl + C is the command to come out of the endless loop.

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
Answer: break is a reserved keyword to come of a loop whenever it encounters it while continue is a reserved keyword to continue inside the loop whenever it is encountered.

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
Answer: In for loop, range(10), range(0,10) and range(0,10,1) all generates a dataset of numbers from 0 to 9.
Hence, there is no difference between them.

12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent
program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
Answer:
for i in range(11):
    print(i)

i = 1
while i < 11:
    print(i)
    i += 1

13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after
importing spam?
Answer: We can call a function inside a module after importing it in the following manner:
spam.bacon()
