1. What exactly is []?
Answer: [] is a log bracket used to form a list. It can contain various datatypes inside it.

2. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value "hello"; as the
third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)
Answer: As list is mutable, we can assign values using the index number of the desired place.
In this case, we can assign "hello" to the list variable spam by writing following command:
spam[2] = "hello".

Let's pretend the spam includes the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] for the next three queries
3. What is the value of spam[int(int('3' * 2) / 11)]?
Answer: ['c']

4. What is the value of spam[-1]?
Answer: 'd'

5. What is the value of spam[:2]?
Answer: ['a', 'b']

Let's pretend bacon has the list [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True] for the next three questions.
6. What is the value of bacon.index('cat')?
Answer: 1

7. How does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?
Answer: append is a builtin method of list class which attached the given value at the end of the list dataset.
Hence, the final outcome of the above code will be: [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]

8. How does bacon.remove('cat') change the look of the list in bacon?
Answer: remove is a builtin method of list class which removes the dataset specified in its argument while calling.
It removes the identical dataset at its first occurrence.
Hence, the outcome of the above code will be:  [3.14, 11, 'cat', True, 99]

9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?
Answer: + is the list concatenation operator while * is the list replication oeprators.

10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?
Answer: append() method take only 1 argument as a dataset and adds the given dataset inside it at the end of the list.
insert() method takes 2 argument. first is the index before which the data need to place and second is the value of the dataset that needs to be inserted.

11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?
Answer: Two methods for removing the dataset from a list is pop() and remove().
The only difference between them is the argument given to them. pop() take the argument in index number while remove() takes the argument in form of value of the dataset.

12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.
Answer: list and string values are identical on terms of their iterability. Both the values are iterable.
However, list is mutable but string is immutable. While list can contain all type of data, string can only contain string dataset.

13. What's the difference between tuples and lists?
Answer: List are written inside [] while tuples are written inside ().
Lists are mutable while tuples are immutable.

14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?
Answer: (42)

15. How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?
Answer: list[tuple(values)] converts the values inside the tuples to values inside a list.
tuple(list[values]) converts the values inside the list into a tuple.

16. Variables that contain list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they
contain?
Answer: Variables that contain list values need not be lists only. They can be tuples, dictionaries or sets

17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?
Answer: copy.copy() creates the copy of the objects reference, i.e., the address of the object reference name is different but the address of the objects remain same.
However, copy.deepcopy() creates a new object reference along with the new references for the objects also.
